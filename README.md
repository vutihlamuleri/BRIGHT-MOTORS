My analysis followed a structured data pipeline:

Data Extraction & Processing (Snowflake): I wrote and executed a complex SQL query to extract, filter, and aggregate raw sales data from a Snowflake data warehouse. This involved data cleaning, creating calculated fields (like profit margin and an odometer classification), and parsing dates.

Data Analysis & Visualization (Excel): I imported the processed dataset into Excel, where I created multiple pivot tables and corresponding charts to explore different dimensions of the business, including revenue, pricing, sales volume, and customer preferences.

Insights & Reporting (PowerPoint): I synthesized the key findings from the charts into a clear and compelling PowerPoint presentation, culminating in a set of strategic recommendations for the business.
